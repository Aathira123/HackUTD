# HomeFit
This project was created as part of HackUTD.
This is a Web app that shows whether the user is eligible for buying home, based on their financial history.
Our intuitive website simplifies the path to homeownership. User can easily input their monthly income, existing debts (such as car payments ,credit card payments etc), credit score and so on. Our platform will swiftly determine their eligibility for a home loan. If the user doesn't meet the criteria , we provide them with suggestions and recommendations to improve their financial situation making this a one stop solution for all homebuying needs.
